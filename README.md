## umap-local.sh: A customized run script for using Umap on a local workstation

**Mappability** is a key metric in genomics, especially when working with data from short-read sequencing.
[**In my blog post**](https://keun-hong.github.io/bioinformatics/umap-mappability/), I have outlined the concept of genome mappability and the process of calculating it using the Umap tool.
